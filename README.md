Purpose: To extract SQLs from a DBTrace file created by PowerBuilder code.
Details: PowerBuilder has a runtime debugger built in, which can be turned on
by running the application executable generated by PB with a command line option of /PBTRACE.
When this is done, every line of code is traced and printed to a file. This is typically in DBTrace.log,
but can be changed.

The trace file thus generated is huge and often contains all the events generated in the UI, SQLs from
backend. (Remember PB is 2-tier). When you want to troubleshoot a data issue, you may want to see how the 
SQL is sent. (particularly, if it is dynamically generated or from a Datawindow). By looking at successive SQLs,
you can check the Data hierarchy. 

Since the DBTrace.log file captures every event, the log could get really large pretty soon, thus making it
difficult to edit it and get to any specific SQL, we want to troubleshoot. That's what this script addresses:
It extracts out all the SQLs from the file to a new file. Thus giving us a file with manageable size.
I used it in troubleshooting PB issues. (Our PB backend code was running in EA Server and that's where the DBTrace
was generated from).

Usage: pbtrcsqls -f <filename>
    Where filename is the name of the trace log file from PB
    ypically saved in Windows directory
    pbtrcsqls -f c:\\windows\\dbtrace.log > dbtrace.sql
